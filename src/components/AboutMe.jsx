            I'm a Informatics Engineering student and appasionate for the Web
            Development from Chile, in the last summer I've build some projects
            to improve my skills in web sites and aplications development, I
            wish in the future collaborate in bigger projects and interact with
            other developers. I'm looking for any opportunity to adquire
            experience in this area. I specialize in React Apps, with CSS
            frameworks. I'm not english native speaker, but I can normally
            express my ideas , discusing and writing in english.
